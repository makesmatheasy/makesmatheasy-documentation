# Supplementary Angle Calculator
- Supplementary angles are those angles that measure up to 180 degrees. For example, angle 130° and angle 50° are supplementary because on adding 130° and 50° we get 180°. 
- Similarly, complementary angles add up to 90 degrees. The two supplementary angles, if joined together, form a straight line and a straight angle.
- But it should be noted that the two angles that are supplementary to each other, do not have to be next to each other. Hence, any two angles can be supplementary, if their sum equal to 180°.

- Geometry is one of the important branches of mathematics that deals with the study of different shapes. It initiates the study of lines and angles. 
- A straight line is a line without curves and it is defined as the shortest distance between two points. An angle is formed when the line segment meets at a point.
- This tool calculates supplimentary angle of any given angle

# Complementary Angle
- When the sum of two angles is 90°, then the angles are known as complementary angles. 
- In other words, if two angles add up to form a right angle, then these angles are referred to as complementary angles. Here we say that the two angles complement each other.
- Suppose if one angle is x then the other angle will be 90o – x. Hence, we use these complementary angles for trigonometry ratios, where on ratio complement another ratio by 90 degrees such as;
  - sin (90°- A) = cos A and cos (90°- A) = sin A
  - tan (90°- A) = cot A and cot (90°- A) = tan A
  - sec (90°- A) = cosec A and cosec (90°- A) = sec A

- This tool calculates complementary angle of any given angle

# Coterminal Angle
- In Mathematics, the coterminal angle is defined as an angle, where two angles are drawn in the standard position. Also both have their terminal sides in the same location. 
- For example, the coterminal angle of 45 is 405 and -315. Here 405 is the positive coterminal angle, -315 is the negative coterminal angle.
- This tool calculates coterminal angle of any given angle

# SSS trianlge's Angle
- "SSS" is when we know three sides of the triangle , and want to find the missing angle 
- TO solve an SSS triangle
  - Use the Law of cosines first to calculate one of the angles
  - Use the law of cosines again to find another angle functionsFinally Use angles of a triangle to add 180 Degree to find the last angle function
- This tool calculates SSS triangle's Angle

# Coordinate Systems
- Cartesian Coordinate Systems
  - it uses the concept of mutually perpendicular lines to denote the coordinate of a point.
  - To locate the position of a point in  a plane using two perpendicular lines, we use the cartesian coordinates system.
  - Points are represented in the form of coordinates (x,y) in two dimensional with respect to x and y axes.
  - The x - coordinate of a point is its perpendicular distance from the y - axis measured along the x - axis and it is known as Abscissa.
  - The y - coordinate of a point is its perpendicular distance from the x- axis measured along the y-axis and it is known as Ordinate

- Polar coordinate system
  - here a point is chosen as the pole and a ray from this point is taken as the polar axis, basically , we have two parameters namely angle and radius .
  - the andgle with the polar axis has a single line through the pole measured anti - clockwise from the axis to the line
  - The point will have a unique distance from the origin (r), thus a point inpolar coordinate system is represented as a pair of coordinates (r,theta).
  - the pole is represneted by  $$ (0,\theta) $$ for any value of $$ \theta , $$ where r = 0.
  - the distance from the pole is called the radical coordinate, radical distance or simply radius and the angular coordinate, polar angle or azimuth
  - consider the figure below that depicts the relationship betweenpolar and cartesian coordinates 

<p>

$$ x = r cos \theta and y = r sin \theta $$
$$ r = \sqrt{x^2  + y^2} and tan\theta = \dfrac{y}{x} $$

- the coordinate p is the distance from P to the origin of theif the point Q is the projection of P to the xy-plane, then $$ \theta  $$ is the angle between the positive x - axis and the line segment from the origin t Q.
- Lastly is the angle between the positive z -axis and the line segmnet from the origin to P

# Manhattan Distance
- The Manhattan distance between two vectors (city blocks) is equal to the one-norm of the distance between the vectors. The distance function (also called a “metric”) involved is also called the “taxi cab” metric.
- The Manhattan distance as the sum of absolute differences

  - ManhattanDistance [{a, b, c}, {x, y, z}]

  - Abs [a − x] + Abs [b − y] + Abs [c − z]

- The one-norm as Manhattan distance between two city blocks

  - block1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}; block2 = {5, 6, 7, 8};

  - Norm[block1 − block2, 1]

  - 16

- The Manhattan length of two blocks

  - block1 = {5, 2, − 3, 4}; block2 = {1, 6, − 7, 8};

  - Norm{Norm[block1, 1], Norm[block2, 1]}

  - {14, 22}

# Cartesian Coordinate Calculator
- Cartesian coordinates allow one to specify the location of a point in the plane, or in three-dimensional space. The Cartesian coordinates (also called rectangular coordinates) of a point are a pair of numbers (in two-dimensions) or a triplet of numbers (in three-dimensions) that specified signed distances from the coordinate axis.

- This tool converts cylinderical coordinates to cartesian coordinates

# Spherical Coordinate Calculations
- Spherical coordinates can be a little challenging to understand at first. 
- Spherical coordinates determine the position of a point in three-dimensional space based on the distance ρ from the origin and two angles θ and ϕ. 
- If one is familiar with polar coordinates, then the angle θ isn't too difficult to understand as it is essentially the same as the angle θ from polar coordinates.

# Cylindrical Coordinate Calculatior
- Cylindrical coordinates are a generalization of two-dimensional polar coordinates to three dimensions by superposing a height (z) axis. Unfortunately, there are a number of different notations used for the other two coordinates. Either r or rho is used to refer to the radial coordinate and either phi or theta to the azimuthal coordinates. Arfken (1985), for instance, uses (rho,phi,z), while Beyer (1987) uses (r,theta,z). In this work, the notation (r,theta,z) is used.

- 3D geometry involves the mathematics of shapes in 3D space and involving 3 coordinates which are x-coordinate, y-coordinate and z-coordinate. In a 3d space, three parameters are required to find the exact location of a point
- In mathematics, we generally come across Cartesian geometry,where we basically deal with location of a point in x-y plane.This is called 2-D geometry. 
- Hence,3-D Geometry is nothing but an extension of this 2-D geometry taking into consideration three orthogonal axes,viz., x,y and z axes in Cartesian geometry, for example.For a practical example,we can consider a circle,which can be drawn on a piece of paper,i.e.,plane but cannot be realized in practical world.
- Likewise, we can have a ball in our hand,which is a sphere, the 3-D analogue of circle,but we can't draw it on paper.As many number of axes included,as many number of dimensions : this is the firsthand general rule that is followed.The 3-D geometry is sometimes also called Solid Geometry, since it deals with solid or 3-D objects that we encounter in our daily life.
- Further extensions of this geometry lead to tensors and manifolds,which were included in Einstein's Theory of Relativity.

# Area of crescent and lune
## What is a crescent?
- Geometrical regions consisting of two circular arcs separate into two groups:
  - A convex-convex region, in which both arcs curve outwards, is called a lens; and
  - A concave-convex region, in which one arc curves outwards and one arc is curved inwards, is called a lune. You can also understand this geometrical shape as one disk partly covering another disk.
  - So, what is a crescent? A crescent is a lune which does not include the original disk's center. It means that the distance between the disk centers is smaller than the radius of the covering disk.

## What is lune
- In plane geometry, a lune is the concave-convex region bounded by two circular arcs. It has one boundary portion for which the connecting segment of any two nearby points moves outside the region and another boundary portion for which the connecting segment of any two nearby points lies entirely inside the region. 
- A convex-convex region is termed a lens. 
- The word lune derives from luna, the Latin word for "moon".
- Formally, a lune is the relative complement of one disk in another (where they intersect but neither is a subset of the other). Alternatively, if {\displaystyle A}A and {\displaystyle B}B are disks, then it is a lune.

- this tool calculates the area of crescent and lune regions along with solving steps

## 3-D SHapes Inscribed
- In geometry, an inscribed planar shape or solid is one that is enclosed by and "fits snugly" inside another geometric shape or solid. To say that "figure F is inscribed in figure G" means precisely the same thing as "figure G is circumscribed about figure F". 
- A circle or ellipse inscribed in a convex polygon (or a sphere or ellipsoid inscribed in a convex polyhedron) is tangent to every side or face of the outer figure (but see Inscribed sphere for semantic variants). A polygon inscribed in a circle, ellipse, or polygon (or a polyhedron inscribed in a sphere, ellipsoid, or polyhedron) has each vertex on the outer figure; if the outer figure is a polygon or polyhedron, there must be a vertex of the inscribed polygon or polyhedron on each side of the outer figure. 
- An inscribed figure is not necessarily unique in orientation; this can easily be seen, for example, when the given outer figure is a circle, in which case a rotation of an inscribed figure gives another inscribed figure that is congruent to the original one.
- Familiar examples of inscribed figures include circles inscribed in triangles or regular polygons, and triangles or regular polygons inscribed in circles. 
- A circle inscribed in any polygon is called its incircle, in which case the polygon is said to be a tangential polygon. 
- 
- A polygon inscribed in a circle is said to be a cyclic polygon, and the circle is said to be its circumscribed circle or circumcircle.
- The inradius or filling radius of a given outer figure is the radius of the inscribed circle or sphere, if it exists.
- 
- The definition given above assumes that the objects concerned are embedded in two- or three-dimensional Euclidean space, but can easily be generalized to higher dimensions and other metric spaces.
- For an alternative usage of the term "inscribed", see the inscribed square problem, in which a square is considered to be inscribed in another figure (even a non-convex one) if all four of its vertices are on that figure.

- this tool can be used to find shapes that can perfectly inscribe in another 3d shape

## Fundamental Theorem of Proportionality

- If a line parllel to one of the sides of a triangle intersects the other two sides in distinct points, then the segments of the other two sides in one halfplane are proportional to the segments in the other half plane.

- Using the fundamentals theorem on proportionality, we can obtain some results:

- If a line parallel to one side of a triangle intersects the other two sides of the triangle in distinct points, the segments of the other side of the triangle in the same halfplane of the line are proportional to the corresponding sides of the triangle

# Bilinear Interpolation 
- In mathematics, bilinear interpolation is an extension of linear interpolation for interpolating functions of two variables (e.g., x and y) on a rectilinear 2D grid.
- Bilinear interpolation is performed using linear interpolation first in one direction, and then again in the other direction. 
- Although each step is linear in the sampled values and in the position, the interpolation as a whole is not linear but rather quadratic in the sample location.
- Bilinear interpolation is one of the basic resampling techniques in computer vision and image processing, where it is also called bilinear filtering or bilinear texture mapping.

- Mid Point Theorem : To find mid-point of a line connecting two points
  - consider the same points A and B , having coordinates to be (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) respectively
  - Let m(x,y) be the mid point of lying on the line connecting these two point A and B.
  - The coordinates of the point M is given as 
  - $$ M(x,y) = (\dfrac{x1+x2}{2},\dfrac{y1+y2}{2}) $$


- Angle Formula : To find the angle between two lines
  - consider two lines A and B,having their slopes to be m1 and 2m respectively
  - let theta be the angle between these two lines , then the angle betwen them can be represented as 
  - $$ tan \theta = \dfrac{m1-m2}{1+m1m2} $$

- Section Formula : To find a point which divides a line into m:n ratio
  - consider a Line A and B having coordinates (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) respectively
  - let p be a point that which divides the line in the ratio m:n
  - then the coordinates of the point P is given as
  - when the ratio m:n is internal
  - $$ \dfrac{mx2+nx1}{m+n}, \dfrac{my2+ny1}{m+n} $$
  - when the ratio m:n is external
  - $$ \dfrac{mx2-nx1}{m-n}, \dfrac{my2-ny1}{m-n} $$


# Curve Tracing
- For Cartesian curves
  - Symmetry
    - If even powers of x, then symmetrical about y axis
    - if even power of y, then symmetrical about x axis
    - if replacing y by x no change in curve, symmetrical about y = x

  - Origin
    - If curve has no constant term, equate to 0 the lowest degree term to get equation of tangent at origin

  - Asymptotes
    - for asymptotes parallel to x axis, equate highest degree's coefficient of x to 0
    - for asympototes parallel to y axis, equate highest degrees coefficient y to 0

  - Region
    - Using logic find regions in which the corve will lie 
    - Use wavy curve method to find the region 

  - Point Of intersection
    - Putrtain values of x to get corresponding values of y and plot them to get final answer
- For Polar Curves
  - Symmetry
    - to check for any angle theta for symmetry for $$ (2\alpha-\theta) $$ , if curve remains same then symmetrical
  - Pole
    -   Put r = 0 to get equation of tangent at pole
  - Asymptotes
    - put r = infinity to get asyptotes
  - Region
    - Put xtreme values of cosine/sine to get region in which curve lie
  - Point of intersection
    - point of values of theta to get specific value of r, then plot


# Civa and Thales Theorem
## Civa's theorem
- Ceva’s theorem, in geometry, theorem concerning the vertices and sides of a triangle. 
- In particular, the theorem asserts that for a given triangle ABC and points L, M, and N that lie on the sides AB, BC, and CA, respectively, a necessary and sufficient condition for the three lines from vertex to point opposite (AM, BN, CL) to intersect at a common point (be concurrent) is that the following relation hold between the line segments formed on the triangle:
BM∙CN∙AL = MC∙NA∙LB.

- Civa's theorem is a theorem about triangles in plane geometry
- Another form of the theorem is that three concurrent lines from the polygon vertices of a triangle divide the opposite sides in such fashion that the product of three non adjacent segments equals the product of the other three
  

 ## Thales Theorem
- If three points A, B, and C lie on the circumference of a circle, whereby the line AC is the diameter of the circle, then the angle ∠ABC is a right angle (90°).
- The diameter of a circle always subtends a right angle to any point on the circle.

- You noticed that the Thales theorem is a special case of the inscribed angle theorem (the central angle = twice the inscribed angle).

- Thales theorem is attributed to Thales, a Greek mathematician and philosopher who was based in Miletus. Thales first initiated and formulated the Theoretical Study of Geometry to make astronomy a more exact science.
