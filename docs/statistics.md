## Weighted Mean Calculator
- Weighted Mean is an average computed by giving different weights to some of the individual values. If all the weights are equal, then the weighted mean is the same as the arithmetic mean.
- It represents the average of a given data. 
- The Weighted mean is similar to the arithmetic mean or sample mean. 
- The Weighted mean is calculated when data is given in a different way compared to the arithmetic mean or sample mean.
- Weighted means generally behave in a similar approach to arithmetic means, they do have a few counter-instinctive properties. 
- Data elements with a high weight contribute more to the weighted mean than the elements with a low weight.
- The weights cannot be negative. 
- Some may be zero, but not all of them; since division by zero is not allowed. 
- Weighted means play an important role in the systems of data analysis, weighted differential and integral calculus.
- The Weighted mean for given set of non-negative data x1,x2,x3,….xn with non-negative weights w1,w2,w3,….wn can be derived from the formula given below.
  
<p>
$$ \bar x = \dfrac{W_{1} X_{1} + W_{2} X_{2} + ... + W_{n} X_{n} }{W_{1} + W_{2} + ... + W_{n}} $$
$$ where \enspace \\ x \enspace is \enspace repeating \enspace value \\ w \enspace is \enspace the \enspace number \enspace of \enspace occurrences \enspace of \enspace x (weight) \\ \bar x \enspace is \enspace the \enspace weighted \enspace mean $$
</p>

- Use Following calculator to calculate weighted mean

# Mean Median and Mode
- MEAN : The mean is the average of a data set.

<p>
$$ \bar x = \dfrac{\sum x}{n} $$
</p>

- MODE : The mode is the most common number in a data set.

<p>

$$ the \enspace value \enspace which \enspace occurs \enspace most \enspace frequently $$

</p>

- MEDIAN :The median is the middle of the set of numbers.

<p>
$$ if n \enspace is \enspace odd, \enspace then \\ M = \dfrac{n+1}{2}term \\ if n \enspace is \enspace even, \enspace then \\ M = \dfrac{\dfrac{n}{2}^{th} term + (\dfrac{n}{2}+1)^{th} term}{2} $$
<p>

- VARIANCE : 
  - Variance is the numerical values that describe the variability of the observations from its arithmetic mean and denoted by sigma-squared(σ2 )
  - Variance measure how far individuals in the group are spread out, in the set of data from the mean.

<p>

$$ \sigma^2 = \dfrac{\sum(x-\bar x)^2}{n} $$

</p>

- Standar Deviation 
  - It is a measure of dispersion of observation within dataset relative to their mean.It is square root of the variance and denoted by Sigma (σ) .
  - Standard deviation is expressed in the same unit as the values in the dataset so it measure how much observations of the data set differs from its mean.

<p>
$$ S = \sigma = \sqrt \dfrac{\sum(x-\bar x)^2}{n} $$
</p>

- Use following calculator to calculate mean, median , mode , varinace and standard deviation on provided give data set

##  Sensitivity and Specificity

- Sensitivity 
  - The sensitivity of a test is also called the true positive rate (TPR) and is the proportion of samples that are genuinely positive that give a positive result using the test in question. For example, a test that correctly identifies all positive samples in a panel is very sensitive. Another test that only detects 60 % of the positive samples in the panel would be deemed to have lower sensitivity as it is missing positives and giving higher a false negative rate (FNR). Also referred to as type II errors, false negatives are the failure to reject a false null hypothesis (the null hypothesis being that the sample is negative).
- Specificity 
  -  The specificity of a test, also referred to as the true negative rate (TNR), is the proportion of samples that test negative using the test in question that are genuinely negative. For example, a test that identifies all healthy people as being negative for a particular illness is very specific. Another test that incorrectly identifies 30 % of healthy people as having the condition would be deemed to be less specific, having a higher false positive rate (FPR). Also referred to as type I errors, false positives are the rejection of a true null hypothesis (the null hypothesis being that the sample is negative).

# Standard Deviation
- What Is Standard Deviation?
  - A standard deviation is a statistic that measures the dispersion of a dataset relative to its mean. The standard deviation is calculated as the square root of variance by determining each data point's deviation relative to the mean. If the data points are further from the mean, there is a higher deviation within the data set; thus, the more spread out the data, the higher the standard deviation.
  - Standard deviation is an especially useful tool in investing and trading strategies as it helps measure market and security volatility—and predict performance trends. As it relates to investing, for example, an index fund is likely to have a low standard deviation versus its benchmark index, as the fund's goal is to replicate the index.
- S.D is given by
 
<p>
$$ S = \sigma = \sqrt \dfrac{\sum(x-\bar x)^2}{n} $$
$$ x = observations \enspace given \\ \bar x = mean \\ n = total \enspace number \enspace of \enspace observations $$
<p>

- Use following tool to calculate S.D
