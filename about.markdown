### Future Scope
- To add more useful calculators to solve Math problems along with steps
- To show steps of Integration, Differentiation, Laplace, Partial Differentiation rather than showing on eMathHelp website by redirecting to it
- Improving the UI
- Adding Image/Handwriting recognition so that user can click/write a  problem and converted to text for further processing

Feel free to come up with new ideas yourself.
